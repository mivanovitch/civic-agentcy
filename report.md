2024 Global Advertising Spend Outlook Report

1. Global Advertising Market Overview
According to multiple industry forecasters, global advertising spending is projected to see healthy growth in the range of 4.6% ([GroupM](https://www.groupm.com/this-year-next-year-global-mid-year-forecast-update/)) to 6.3% ([Magna](https://magnaglobal.com/magna-advertising-forecasts-june-2022/)) in 2024, reaching $795-873 billion. This marks an acceleration from more modest growth expectations in 2023, as the ad market is poised to rebound. However, persistent media price inflation driven by economic conditions may put a damper on growth rates.

2. Ad Spend Growth by Media Type
Digital advertising will remain the primary engine of overall ad spend increases, with forecasted year-over-year growth rates ranging from 8-11% ([GroupM](https://www.groupm.com/this-year-next-year-global-mid-year-forecast-update/), [Magna](https://magnaglobal.com/magna-global-advertising-forecast-december-2022/), [eMarketer](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/worldwide-ad-spending-2023)). Digital ad formats are expected to capture 65-70%+ of total ad budgets in 2024. 

Retail media networks from players like Amazon, Walmart and Instacart are predicted to see robust 10.4% growth to $141.7 billion ([eMarketer](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/global-ad-spending-2023)). Search advertising will expand by 8.8% to $198.6 billion, while social media grows a more modest 6% to $139 billion ([GroupM](https://www.groupm.com/this-year-next-year-global-mid-year-forecast-update/)).

Emerging digital ad channels like CTV, gaming, metaverse and short-form video are likely to attract increased advertiser investment ([Zenith](https://www.zenithmedia.com/insights/advertising-expenditure-forecasts-december-2022/)). Meanwhile, traditional media ad spending is projected to be flat or grow slightly up to 3%, with TV spending buoyed by major cyclical events ([GroupM](https://www.groupm.com/this-year-next-year-global-mid-year-forecast-update/), [Magna](https://magnaglobal.com/magna-advertising-forecasts-june-2022/)).

3. Geographic Ad Spend Trends  
From a geographic perspective, ad spend growth is expected to be strongest in India (+12.8%), followed by the U.S. (+5.8%), Brazil (+5.6%) and China (+4.5%) according to [GroupM forecasts](https://www.groupm.com/this-year-next-year-global-mid-year-forecast-update/). Western Europe will lag other regions with +1.8% growth due to economic headwinds ([GroupM](https://www.groupm.com/this-year-next-year-global-mid-year-forecast-update/)). 

The US and Canada are expected to account for nearly $328 billion in ad spending and remain the largest region, while emerging markets in Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Middle East are anticipated to outpace more mature regions in growth rates.
